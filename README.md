<p>
Once the ticket is created, an agent can go in and observe the details and assign it to a team or another agent, change the SLA plan, or update the help topic if necessary.

<p>
Now the ticket can be worked by the appointed team or agent to completion. In this case, the worker responded to the issue with an update after looking into what the problem could be. The thread of comments under the ticket details help keep the customer informed on what is happening. It is important to maintain communication so that the customer doesn't feel neglected and is assured that their problem is being taken care of.

Finally, the ticket has been resolved and it can be closed. The agent can update the status from "Open" to "Resolved". The "Tickets" shows that it is no longer open.
